Reflector! An Android puzzle game developed in Unity3D by a group of 4 students :)


Solve puzzles of increasing difficulty by moving your character to the 'star', or end. Reflector uses 'delayed input', meaning movements won't be preformed until the 'play' button is pressed. This forces the player to think out all of their movements well in advance.
Move to the green lever and tap 'activate' to 'reflect' the red cubes over the line on the screen. Be careful, as the orientation of this line will change from map to map! Study the map fully to predict where the red cubes will end up, so you do not run into them.

Practice your skills in 'Normal' mode, then earn achievements and high scores in 'Speed' mode
